/** A modular class for calculating dissonance.
 
    With this class, you can modularly use dissonance models and preprocessing algorithms to calculate the dissonance of timbres, intervals, and chords. Dissonance values can be calculated for a single chord or many, as well as for ranges of frequencies that result in dissonance curves and surfaces (collectively refered to in DisMAL as dissonance maps).
 
    Dissonance maps are limited to two- and three-dimensions (one and two frequency dimensions, respectively, plus a dissonance dimension). This is because visual representations of dense, 4+ dimensional data ultimately limit the clarity and usefulness of dissonance maps. More than three overtone distributions can be used to create dissonance maps, but only one or two distributions can have variable frequencies that step over the frequency range. The rest must have fixed fundamental frequencies.
